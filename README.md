# simple-js-app "PokéHome"

## Project description

My Pokéhome App is a compact web application with a collection of Pokémons.
Each Pokémon is represented by a button.
By clicking the button, images and key characteristics of the respective Pokémon are displayed in a modal. Images and data of the Pokémon are fetched from an external API.
I used the following technologies to develop the app:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap.
